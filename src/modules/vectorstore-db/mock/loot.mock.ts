Points are dynamically calculated and adjusted to ensure a sustainable flywheel for \nall parties involved.  \nReward Calculation  \nThe individual reward for a staker is calculated by determining their share of the total points. This is done \nby dividing the weight of an individual’s points by the total points of all stakers.  \nRewards are then distributed proportionally based on each staker’s share of the total staking weight. This \nensures that rewards are fairly allocated, with those contributing more (either by amount or duration) \nreceiving a larger share of the rewards.',
